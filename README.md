"Pulp Diction" CCLab Javascript Final project

"Pulp Diction" loads up a blank pulp novel cover and allows the user to generate a random title for the novel, using the Wordnik API. The user can also change the cover image displayed behind the title (using the Chance.js library to pull from an array of title-less cover images I made in Photoshop). 

The titles generated by the API range from the hilariously absurd to the completely esoteric, and the user can hover over each word to see its definition. The definitions are populated in a hoverbox using the JQuery Hovercard plugin. 

I made this because I...

A) love pulp novels
B) love learning obscure new words
and C) wanted to make something with a fun element of surprise/randomness to amuse myself when the stress of DT becomes simply too much and I need a break to screw around on the internet.

Enjoy!
